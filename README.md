# London Housing Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a data science project examining the London housing market's evolution over the past twenty years. The central goal was to ascertain which boroughs have seen the most substantial increases in housing prices during this period.

## Methodology

Using Python and libraries such as `pandas` for data wrangling and `matplotlib` for visualization, this project traversed various stages of data analysis:

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the integrity and quality of the housing data.
- **Data Transformation**: Structuring the data for ease of analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns and insights within the data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculating the growth ratios and visualizing the price trends across boroughs.

## Repository Contents

- `London_Housing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis including code, comments, and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed data used in the analysis.
- `visuals/`: Directory with generated figures and charts.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies for reproducing the analysis environment.

## Conclusions

The project's findings provide a clear view of the dynamic nature of the housing market in London, revealing significant price increases in several boroughs, with Croydon, Harrow, and Hillingdon leading the pack. These insights serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders like urban planners, real estate investors, and policymakers.
